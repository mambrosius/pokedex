# Pokedex

This is a simple demo app, used to play around and experiment with Swift. 

The app uses [pokeapi.co](https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/) to fetch a list of pokemons, and show some of their related details.

The feature set may be extended in the future.

## Requirements

- iOS 12.0+
- Xcode 10.0+

## Installation

The app uses [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) to manage external packages. The following Swift Packages are used in the app:
- [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift)
- [Kingfisher](https://github.com/onevcat/Kingfisher)

#### SwiftLint
The app uses [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint) to enforce linting rules. This tool can be installed with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh), or your preferred package manager.
